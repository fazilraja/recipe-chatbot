      "### Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon coconut oil or vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1 thumb-sized piece of ginger, grated\n",
      "- 1 medium carrot, sliced\n",
      "- 1 bell pepper (any color), sliced\n",
      "- 1 zucchini, sliced\n",
      "- 1 cup canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n",
      "- 1 can (13.5 oz) coconut milk\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon curry powder\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n",

      "### Instructions:\n",
      "1. **Heat the oil:** In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the coconut oil over medium heat until shimmering.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sauté aromatics:** Add the chopped onion and cook for about 3-4 minutes until softened and translucent. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute until fragrant.\n",

      "3. **Add spices:** Stir in the curry powder, turmeric, cumin, salt, and pepper. Cook for about 30 seconds to release their aromas.\n",

      "4. **Cook vegetables:** Add the sliced carrot, bell pepper, and zucchini. Stir well to coat everything evenly with the spices. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until vegetables start to soften.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Pour in coconut milk:** Add the coconut milk and chickpeas, stirring to combine. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Simmer:** Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let simmer for 10-15 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the flavors meld together.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Taste and adjust:** Check seasoning and add more salt or spices if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Serve:** Ladle the curry into bowls, garnish with chopped cilantro, and add lime wedges if desired. You can serve it with rice or naan on the side.\n",
